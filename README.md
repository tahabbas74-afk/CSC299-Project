Here are some good ideas for using Notion and Obsidian to support your AI coding studies:

Notion:

Create a study dashboard with links to resources, courses, and progress trackers
Organize notes by topic: Python, ML, Deep Learning, Projects, etc.
Build a database of AI algorithms with explanations and code snippets
Track project ideas and progress with Kanban boards
Maintain a glossary of AI terms and concepts
Collect useful articles, videos, and tutorials
Obsidian:

Use backlinks to connect concepts (e.g., link “Neural Networks” to “Backpropagation”)
Create a knowledge graph of AI topics
Write daily learning journals and reflections
Store code snippets and troubleshooting notes in markdown files
Build a personal wiki for AI concepts and project documentation
Use tags for quick navigation (e.g., #math, #ml, #project)
Both tools are great for organizing your learning, tracking progress, and building a personal knowledge base.

Here are some prototype ideas for AI coding projects:

Chatbot: Build a simple conversational agent using NLP libraries.
Image Classifier: Create a model to recognize objects in images.
Sentiment Analyzer: Analyze text to determine positive or negative sentiment.
Recommendation System: Suggest products or content based on user preferences.
AI-powered To-Do List: Use ML to prioritize tasks or predict deadlines.
Automated Note Tagger: Classify and tag notes using AI.
Personal Study Assistant: Track learning progress and suggest next topics.
Voice Command App: Control devices or apps using speech recognition.
Data Visualizer: Generate interactive charts from datasets using AI insights.
Code Auto-completion Tool: Suggest code snippets or complete lines using ML.
These prototypes can be built using Python, popular AI libraries, and integrated with tools like Notion or Obsidian for enhanced productivity.
